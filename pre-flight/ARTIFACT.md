## Notes

- Pre-flight findings are always inline — no file is written and the working index stays clean
- Pre-flight's committed artifact is the updated plan file — produced by the reasoning pass that follows and committed as `[plan]`
- In the leeroyyyyy pipeline, pre-flight findings are consumed in-context by the reasoning subagent

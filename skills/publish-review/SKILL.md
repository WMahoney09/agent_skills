# Publish Review: Deliver Findings as Inline PR Comments

This skill takes `/review` findings from conversation context and posts them as a structured GitHub review with inline comments anchored to the actual diff lines. Reviewers see each finding in context without navigating away from the diff.

## Invocation

- **`/publish-review #N`** — Post findings to PR #N in the current repo
- **`/publish-review #N owner/repo`** — Post findings to PR #N in another repo

## Goal

Deliver `/review` findings directly onto a pull request as a single GitHub review with inline comments anchored to diff lines, so reviewers see each finding in the context where it matters.

## Agent's Role

### Step 1: Extract Findings from Conversation

Read back through the conversation to find the most recent `/review` output. For each finding, extract:

- **Severity** (Critical, Major, Minor)
- **Description** (the issue)
- **File and line** (`file:line` reference)
- **Why it matters** (Critical/Major only)
- **Suggestion** (recommended fix or direction)

Also check whether the `/review` output is a **re-review** — i.e., it references prior findings as "resolved" or "addressed." For each resolved prior finding, extract the description and prior severity so they can be matched to existing threads in Step 3.

If no `/review` output is found in the conversation, stop and report:

```
No review findings in this conversation. Run /review or /review #N first, then /publish-review #N to post the findings.
```

### Step 2: Fetch PR Diff and Map Findings

Fetch the PR diff and metadata. Derive `{owner}/{repo}` from the git remote origin (e.g., `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner`), or from the `owner/repo` argument if the user provided one.

```
gh pr diff #N
gh pr view #N --json number,title,author,url
```

**Reconciliation check:** If the `/review` output targeted a specific PR (e.g., "Pull Request: #5"), compare it against the target PR number. If they differ, surface a warning before proceeding:

```
⚠ Review findings are from PR #5, but you're publishing to PR #7. Proceed anyway?
```

This preserves flexibility for intentional cross-posting while preventing accidental mismatch.

Classify each finding into one of three buckets:

| Bucket | Condition | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **Inline** | File is in the diff AND line falls within a hunk | Comment anchored at that line |
| **File-level** | File is in the diff BUT line is outside any hunk | Comment with `subject_type: "file"` |
| **Body-only** | File not in the diff OR no `file:line` reference | Included in the top-level review body |

### Step 3: Check for Existing Feedback

Fetch existing review comments on the PR:

```
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{N}/comments
```

Build a location index: `file:line → comment[]`. For each finding:

- If the finding's `file:line` matches an existing comment on the same file at the same source line (or within ±3 source lines) **and** the comment content overlaps in topic (similar keywords or issue description), flag it as "already covered". Proximity alone is not sufficient — both location and content must suggest the same issue.
- Record the existing comment's author and a snippet for the confirmation step

**Thread resolution (re-review only):** If Step 1 identified resolved prior findings, fetch review threads via GraphQL:

```
gh api graphql -f query='query { repository(owner: "{owner}", name: "{repo}") {
  pullRequest(number: N) {
    reviewThreads(first: 50) {
      nodes { id isResolved comments(first: 1) { nodes { body } } }
    }
  }
} }'
```

Match each resolved finding to an unresolved thread by comparing the finding description against the thread's first comment body. The match should be based on content similarity (severity tag, key phrases, file reference) — not position alone. Flag matched threads for resolution in Step 5.

### Step 4: Format Comments

**Inline comment format:**

```
**[Severity]** Finding description

_Why it matters:_ Specific risk or consequence.

Suggestion or recommended fix.
```

- Include "Why it matters" for Critical and Major findings only
- Keep each comment self-contained — a reviewer should understand the issue without seeing the full report

**Top-level body format:**

Follow the template defined in `ARTIFACT.md`.

### Step 5: Present Mapping for Confirmation

Present the full plan before posting. Show:

- Each finding with its bucket assignment (inline / file-level / body-only)
- Any findings flagged as already covered, with existing comment details
- Threads to be resolved (re-review only), with the matched finding description
- Counts by bucket

For findings flagged as already covered:

```
⚠ ALREADY COVERED:
  [Major] src/service.ts:42 — Missing null check
  Existing comment by @reviewer on line 42: "This needs a null check"
  → Skip (default) / Include anyway?
```

For threads to be resolved (re-review only):

```
✓ RESOLVED (will resolve thread):
  [Major] No guard against PR number mismatch — addressed in latest push
  Thread: PRRT_kwDO... (comment by @reviewer)
```

Default to skipping flagged findings, but the user can override.

Wait for user confirmation before posting.

### Step 6: Post Review and Resolve Threads

**Post new findings** (if any):

Build the review payload as a JSON object:

- `event`: `"COMMENT"` — never `REQUEST_CHANGES` or `APPROVE`
- `body`: the top-level review body (recommendation + rationale + body-only findings)
- `comments`: array of inline and file-level comment objects

Write the payload to `/tmp/pr_review_payload.json` using the Write tool, then post:

```
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{N}/reviews --input /tmp/pr_review_payload.json
```

**Resolve addressed threads** (re-review only):

For each thread flagged for resolution in Step 3, resolve it via GraphQL:

```
gh api graphql -f query='mutation { resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "THREAD_ID"}) { thread { id isResolved } } }'
```

Only resolve threads whose corresponding findings the `/review` output explicitly confirmed as addressed. A reply on the thread is not sufficient — the re-review must have verified the fix.

### Step 7: Report Completion

Report:
- Counts by bucket (inline / file-level / body-only / skipped)
- Threads resolved (re-review only)
- Review URL from the API response (if new findings were posted)

## Edge Cases

**No review in conversation:**
Stop with guidance to run `/review` first. Do not attempt to generate findings.

**All findings outside diff:**
Post a body-only review. Warn in the confirmation step that no inline comments will be anchored to the diff.

**All findings already covered:**
Report "nothing new to post" and do not create an empty review.

**Re-review with all findings resolved, nothing new:**
Resolve the addressed threads and report. Do not post an empty review. This is the happy path for a clean re-review.

**API 422 errors:**
If the API rejects a comment (e.g., invalid line position), retry with the offending comment moved from inline to file-level, or from file-level to body-only.

**PR has no diff:**
Report and stop — there is nothing to annotate.

## Artifact

The GitHub review object is the artifact. `ARTIFACT.md` documents the body template and inline comment format. Generated when the user confirms and the review is posted.

## Closure Criteria

The publish-review is complete when:

- [ ] Findings have been extracted from the most recent `/review` output
- [ ] The PR diff has been fetched and findings mapped to buckets
- [ ] Existing PR comments have been checked for overlap
- [ ] The full mapping has been presented and confirmed by the user
- [ ] The review has been posted as a single atomic GitHub review with event type `COMMENT` (if new findings exist)
- [ ] Addressed threads have been resolved via GraphQL (re-review only)
- [ ] Completion has been reported with counts and review URL

## Notes

- This skill never approves or requests changes — those are human decisions. The review event is always `COMMENT`.
- All comments are posted as a single grouped review — one notification, dismissable as a unit.
- The confirmation gate is mandatory. Never post without user confirmation.
- This skill only publishes findings — it does not generate them. `/review` is the upstream skill.

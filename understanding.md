# Understanding: Discovery Phase Skill

This skill guides you through building a shared understanding of the problem before exploring solutions.

## Goal

Develop a complete, mutual understanding of:
- What problem is being solved
- Why it matters
- What constraints or context exist
- What success looks like
- What's already been tried or considered

## Your Role

As the agent running this skill:
- Ask clarifying questions to uncover assumptions and hidden constraints
- Reflect back what you're hearing to confirm understanding
- Dig into the "why" behind requirements
- Help articulate what "done" looks like
- Identify gaps in the shared understanding

## Critical Boundary: No Solutions in This Phase

**Do not propose, design, or brainstorm solutions during Understanding.** That is explicitly the work of the Solutioning phase. Your job here is discovery and clarification only.

If solutions come up naturally in conversation, acknowledge them but do not develop them. Redirect focus to deeper understanding of the problem itself. The goal is to reach complete alignment on *what* needs to be solved before moving to *how* to solve it.

## Key Questions to Explore

**The Problem:**
- What exactly is the problem we're solving?
- Why is this a problem right now?
- What happens if we don't solve it?

**Context & Constraints:**
- What constraints are we working within? (technical, organizational, time, etc.)
- What context matters? (existing codebase, team size, dependencies)
- Are there things we *cannot* do or change?

**Success Criteria:**
- How will we know this is solved?
- What does success look like?
- Are there acceptance criteria or must-haves?

**Prior Work:**
- What has the person already tried?
- What worked and what didn't?
- Are there related problems that have been solved?

**Tradeoffs:**
- What matters most? (simplicity, performance, flexibility, etc.)
- What can we compromise on?
- Are there hidden tradeoffs we should discuss?

## Closure Criteria

You're ready to move to the next phase when:

- [ ] You have a clear statement of what the problem is
- [ ] You understand why it matters and why now
- [ ] You've identified key constraints and context
- [ ] You both agree on what success looks like
- [ ] Assumptions have been surfaced and discussed
- [ ] The person feels heard and understood

## Closing the Phase

When understanding feels solid, summarize what you've learned:

**"Here's what I'm hearing: [summarize the problem, constraints, and success criteria]. Is that right? Should we move on to exploring solutions?"**

If they want to refine anything, go back and dig deeper on that point. Once aligned, you're ready to hand off to the Exploration phase.

## Notes

- This phase is about listening and asking good questions, not proposing solutions yet
- Don't solve the problem here—just understand it
- The quality of exploration and planning depends on getting this right
- It's better to spend extra time here than to discover misalignment later

  Ask clarifying questions to sharpen and deepen shared understanding built through recon and understanding skills.
  TRIGGER when: the user seeks confirmation of their own understanding ("Am I understanding that right?", "Is that right?", "Am I wrong?", "Correct me if I'm wrong"), or when something in the discussion feels incomplete, contradictory, or ambiguous.

# Clarify: Questioning for Clarity

This skill guides you through asking targeted, purposeful questions that refine and deepen shared understanding.

## Goal

Use strategic questioning to:
- **Clarify ambiguities** - Surface hidden assumptions and inconsistencies
- **Deepen understanding** - Move from surface-level knowledge to foundational comprehension
- **Challenge gently** - Test ideas and mental models without dismissing them
- **Reveal constraints** - Uncover limitations, dependencies, and tradeoffs not yet articulated
- **Connect dots** - Help the person see relationships they may have missed
- **Sharpen definitions** - Ensure aligned vocabulary and precise meaning

## Your Role

As the agent running this skill:
- Ask questions that make the person think, not just answer
- Listen for what's *not* being said as much as what is
- Notice contradictions, gaps, and inconsistencies
- Help distinguish between core principles and surface implementations
- Guide exploration without leading to predetermined conclusions

## Question Types

### Exploratory Questions
These open up new directions and reveal hidden aspects:
- "What would happen if we...?"
- "What's the underlying reason for that constraint?"
- "What would success look like in the opposite scenario?"

### Clarifying Questions
These pin down vague or ambiguous statements:
- "When you say X, do you mean...?"
- "Can you give me an example of that?"
- "How is that different from...?"

### Challenging Questions
These test assumptions and rigor:
- "What if that assumption turned out to be wrong?"
- "Is there a case where that wouldn't work?"
- "What would make you change your mind about that?"

### Connecting Questions
These reveal relationships and dependencies:
- "How does that relate to...?"
- "Does this connect to the earlier point about...?"
- "What would change if we solved this first?"

### Reflective Questions
These check understanding and invite deeper thought:
- "So you're saying that...?"
- "The key constraint here is...?"
- "What's the real bottleneck—is it X or Y?"

## When to Ask

**Use clarify when:**
- Something feels incomplete or contradictory in the shared understanding
- You've noticed an assumption that hasn't been examined
- Someone describes a constraint but hasn't explained the *why*
- A problem statement is clear, but the scope or success criteria are fuzzy
- Multiple interpretations of the same statement are possible
- You've gathered information (recon) and need to synthesize and test understanding

**Don't use clarify to:**
- Be adversarial or argumentative
- Show you're smarter or right about something
- Waste time on questions that won't change the work ahead
- Interrupt productive momentum to be clever

## Key Principles

### Ask Open Questions First
Start broad to reveal the landscape, then narrow based on what emerges:
- Not: "Do you need feature A?"
- Instead: "What would perfect look like for your users?"

### Listen to Non-Answers
When someone struggles to answer, that gap is informative. Explore it:
- "That's a tough question—why is it hard to answer?"
- "What would it take to know that?"

### Question Your Own Understanding
Turn questions inward too:
- "Am I understanding that right?"
- "Should I be asking something different?"

### Know When to Stop
Not every gap needs immediate filling. Some things clarify through action. Judge when questioning has yielded diminishing returns and it's time to move forward.

### Distinguish Between Questions for Understanding vs. Questions for Decision

**Understanding questions** sharpen what's true (for Recon and Understanding phases):
- "How does the system currently work?"
- "What constraints are we really bound by?"

**Decision questions** help choose between options (for Solutioning and beyond):
- "Which approach fits better?"
- "What should we prioritize?"

Stay focused on understanding during discovery phases.

## Closure Criteria

End clarify when:
- [ ] Ambiguities have been clarified
- [ ] Hidden assumptions have been surfaced and discussed
- [ ] Contradictions have been resolved
- [ ] Both parties feel genuinely understood
- [ ] The foundation is solid enough to move forward
- [ ] Further questions would feel repetitive or unproductive

## Closing the Phase

When interrogation has sharpened understanding, summarize and test closure:

**"Here's what I'm now understanding: [summarize the clarified points]. Is that sharper and more accurate? What else should we examine?"**

If there are still loose threads, continue. If aligned, you're ready to hand off to the next phase.

## Notes

- Questions are not obstacles—they're the work of understanding
- The best questions make the person think differently about the problem
- Keep questions brief and focused (no multi-part compound questions)
- Be genuinely curious, not performatively skeptical
- Questions should deepen, not derail

# Triage: Feedback Ingestion and Revision Planning

This skill ingests feedback from one or more sources, groups related items into unified revisions, prioritizes by severity, and produces a structured report. It is a read-only analysis skill — it makes no code changes.

## Invocation

- **`/triage`** — Triage feedback from the current conversation (review output, a list of issues, etc.)
- **`/triage #N`** — Fetch and triage unresolved PR comments from pull request #N in the current repo
- **`/triage #N owner/repo`** — Fetch and triage unresolved PR comments from a PR in another repo
- **`/triage #N + review`** — Triage both PR comments and review skill output together

## Goal

Produce a clear, prioritized list of revisions that:
- Groups related feedback into unified, actionable units
- Preserves the source of every item so the linkage is always traceable
- Prioritizes by impact so work can be sequenced intelligently
- Is immediately actionable by `/revise`

## Input Sources

### 1. Pull Request Comments

Fetch unresolved review comments from a PR using:
```
gh pr view #N --json reviews,comments
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{N}/comments --jq '[.[] | select(.resolved == false or .resolved == null)]'
```

Only fetch **open, unresolved** comments. Skip comments that have been marked resolved or are outdated.

Also fetch the PR description for context:
```
gh pr view #N --json title,body,baseRefName,headRefName,author
```

### 2. Review Skill Output

When `/review` output is present in the conversation, ingest it directly. The review output is already structured (Critical / Major / Minor / Gaps / Opportunities) — use those categories as input to triage's prioritization pass.

### 3. Conversational List

When the user provides a list of issues directly in conversation — as bullet points, numbered items, or free prose — parse and ingest each discrete item.

### 4. Combined

When multiple sources are present, ingest all of them together and treat the full set as one triage pass. Deduplicate items that appear in more than one source.

## Agent's Role

### Step 1: Ingest All Feedback

Collect everything from the specified source(s). For PR comments, fetch and list all unresolved items. For review output or conversational lists, parse each discrete finding.

### Step 2: Analyze and Group

Look across all items for:

- **Same root cause** — two comments that both stem from the same underlying problem
- **Same pattern** — the same issue appearing in multiple files or locations
- **Same concern** — different phrasings of the same feedback
- **Sequential dependency** — items where fixing one resolves or changes another

Group related items into a single **revision**. A revision is a unified, actionable unit of work. One revision may address multiple source items.

**Preserve linkage:** every source item must be explicitly associated with the revision it belongs to. No item should disappear into a group without being named.

### Step 3: Prioritize

Assign each revision a severity level:

**Critical**
- Security vulnerabilities
- Bugs that cause data loss, corruption, or incorrect behavior in production
- Breaking changes that will block other work or deployments
- Accessibility failures that prevent users from completing core tasks

**Major**
- Logic errors in non-critical paths
- Missing test coverage on changed behavior
- Architectural violations that create meaningful technical debt
- Accessibility issues that significantly degrade the experience
- Feedback that represents a clear gap in the implementation

**Minor**
- Code style inconsistencies
- Naming improvements
- Non-critical test gaps
- Small polish items
- Nice-to-haves

### Step 4: Produce the Report

---

## Report Format

**Source:** [PR #N / Review output / Conversational list / Combined]
**Items ingested:** [total count of raw feedback items]
**Revisions identified:** [count after grouping]

---

### Critical Revisions

**Revision C1:** [Short title describing the unified problem]

> **Addresses:**
> - Comment [#ID or ref]: "[exact quote or close paraphrase of the source comment]"
> - Comment [#ID or ref]: "[quote]" *(if grouped)*

**What needs to change:** [Plain-language description of the unified issue and what a fix looks like]

---

### Major Revisions

**Revision M1:** [Short title]

> **Addresses:**
> - Comment [#ID or ref]: "[quote]"

**What needs to change:** [Description]

---

### Minor Revisions

**Revision m1:** [Short title]

> **Addresses:**
> - Comment [#ID or ref]: "[quote]"

**What needs to change:** [Description]

---

### Items Requiring Clarification

List any feedback items where the intent is ambiguous or conflicting, and triage cannot confidently assign them to a revision without more information.

- Comment [#ID or ref]: "[quote]"
  - **Why unclear:** [brief explanation]
  - **Question:** [what needs to be clarified before this can be actioned]

---

**Summary**

| Severity | Revisions |
|----------|-----------|
| Critical | N |
| Major    | N |
| Minor    | N |
| Needs clarification | N |
| **Total** | **N** |

*Ready for `/revise`. Work Critical revisions first.*

---

## Revision IDs

Each revision receives a stable ID based on its severity tier and position:
- Critical: `C1`, `C2`, `C3`...
- Major: `M1`, `M2`, `M3`...
- Minor: `m1`, `m2`, `m3`...

These IDs are used by `/revise` in commit messages to maintain traceability between revisions and the source feedback they address.

## Closure Criteria

Triage is complete when:

- [ ] All source items have been ingested and accounted for
- [ ] Related items are grouped into revisions with clear linkage shown
- [ ] Every revision has a severity level and a plain-language description of what needs to change
- [ ] Ambiguous items are called out explicitly
- [ ] Revision IDs are assigned
- [ ] Summary table is present

## Notes

- Triage is read-only — it produces a report, it does not change code
- Every source item must appear somewhere in the report — nothing disappears silently into a group
- When combining sources, deduplicate carefully: a finding in the review output and a comment on the same issue are one revision, not two
- Triage ends when the report is delivered; use `/revise` to act on the output
